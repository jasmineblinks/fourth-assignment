HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating web pages. It's a set of instructions that tell web browsers how to display the content of a website, such as text, images, and videos. To explain HTML using a building as an example, we can think of a building as a web page and HTML as the blueprint that outlines the structure and content of the building.

Just as a blueprint defines the different elements of a building, such as the rooms, walls, and doors, HTML defines the different components of a web page, such as paragraphs, headings, and images. Just as a blueprint provides specific instructions for the construction of a building, HTML provides specific instructions for the rendering of a web page.

To continue with the building analogy, let's say you want to build a three-story house with a basement. The blueprint for the house would include instructions for the foundation, walls, floors, and roof, as well as details about the placement of doors, windows, and other features. Similarly, when creating a web page using HTML, you would include instructions for the structure of the page, such as the header, main content, and footer, as well as details about the placement of images, links, and other elements.

Just as a building can be decorated with different materials and finishes, such as paint, wallpaper, or wood paneling, a web page can be styled with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to define the appearance of the page, such as the color, font, and layout.

Tim Berners-Lee created HTML in 1991 with the release of version 1.0. To get you started, you will learn
