Before you begin writing HTML code, you must first set up your environment. You will use a text editor to achieve this. A text editor is used to create HTML code and, in some cases, more advanced features that allow developers to effectively create web applications. There are several editors available for writing HTML code. Here are a few examples:




1. ### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#meet-intellisense)
